		<span class="tab"></span>The Taj Mahal is a tomb built in the 17th century by the Mughal king Shah Jahan in memory of his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. She was his 3rd wife. Eventually, Shah Jahan was entombed in the Taj Mahal with his wife. The Taj Mahal ('Crown of the Palace'), is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the southern bank of the river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.
		<br>
		<br>
		<span class="tab"></span>The building is in the city of Agra, Uttar Pradesh. Widely thought of as one of the most beautiful buildings in the world, it is one of India's biggest tourist attractions. The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts 7–8 million visitors a year and in 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative.

		<span class="tab"></span>The Taj Mahal is an example of Mughal architecture – a mixture of building design ideas from Islamic Indian, Persian (old Iran), and Muslim arts.
		<br>
		<br>
		<span class="tab"></span>The Taj Mahal was constructed with materials from all over the world, and over 20,000 people were used to move building materials. It is generally thought that Ustad Ahmad Lahauri was in charge of the construction. The construction was finished in 1653.

		<P class="ptaj" align="justify">
		<span class="tab"></span>Many people think it is one of the most beautiful buildings ever built. However, it is slowly being damaged by acid rain. A nearby oil refinery has been blamed for some of the damage. In 1996, the Indian Supreme Court said that local industry was harming the Taj Mahal. The court set up an area of 10,400 square meters around the Taj Mahal called the Taj Trapezium Zone. Industries within this zone must use natural gas instead of coal.
		<br>
		<br>
		<span class="tab"></span>There have also been concerns about the effect of visitors on the site. Rajan Kishore, a conservationist from Agra, has said that visitors walking through are putting too much pressure on the Taj Mahal, and suggested that the number of people allowed in be limited.

			<div><h3></B>SOME INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT TAJ MAHAL</B></H3></div>
			</center>
		</div>
		<P class="ptaj" align="justify">
		<span class="tab"></span>1. Sick with grief, Shah Jahan was first inspired to build the Taj Mahal after his third wife, Mumtaz Mahal, died while giving birth to their 14th child. His wife was in labor for 30 hours before she died at age 40.
		<br>
		<br>
		<span class="tab"></span>2. The four minarets (towers) surrounding the Taj Mahal were constructed farther away from the main structure than usual. The minarets also lean slightly outward rather than stand straight. This was done as a safety measure so that if any of them fell, they would fall away from the tomb rather than crash into the central structure.
		<br>
		<br>
		<span class="tab"></span>3. During British rule in India, the garden was landscaped to look more like the manicured lawns in London, England. The original garden was adorned with lots of roses and daffodils.		
		<br>
		<br>
		<span class="tab"></span>4. The Taj Mahal contains a working mosque and is closed on Fridays for prayer. Respect should be shown while visiting because it is an active religious structure. Dress appropriately, despite the heat.
		<br>
		<br>
		<span class="tab"></span>5. There is no proof to support the long-standing myth that artists and architects involved with the construction of the Taj Mahal were later put to death so that they could never "repeat such a beautiful feat." Instead, historians believe that they were required to sign contracts.
		<br>
		<br>
		<span class="tab"></span>6. With construction beginning around 1632 and finishing in 1653, the Taj Mahal took an estimated 22 years to build. Small refinements continued thereafter.
		<br>
		<br>
		<span class="tab"></span>7. Ustad Ahmad Lahauri, generally regarded as the chief architect of the Taj Mahal, was not Indian; he was a Persian from Iran.
		<br>
		<br>
		<span class="tab"></span>8. Islamic tradition forbids the decoration of graves, so Shah Jahan and his wife are actually buried in a plain crypt beneath the main inner chamber of the Taj Mahal.
		<br>
		<br>
		<span class="tab"></span>9. Shah Jahan's other wives and even his favorite servant are buried in mausoleums just outside of the Taj Mahal.
		<br>
		<br>
		<span class="tab"></span>10. Construction of the Taj Mahal cost an estimated 32 million Indian rupees (the equivalent of over US $1 billion at the time).
		<br>
		<br>
		<span class="tab"></span>11. A total of 28 types of precious and semiprecious jewels are set in the marble. The turquoise came from Tibet, and jade came from China. Heavy white marble — the principal building material — was transported from Rajasthan.
		<br>
		<br>
		<span class="tab"></span>12. An estimated 20,000 laborers were recruited from all over Asia to contribute to the massive project. Remnants of their massive encampment, bazaar, and living quarters are now a nearby neighborhood.
		<br>
		<br>
		<span class="tab"></span>13. False structures and scaffolding were constructed around the Taj Mahal throughout different conflicts to confuse German, Japanese, and Pakistani bomber pilots.
		<br>
		<br>
		<span class="tab"></span>14. In 2008, a Bangladeshi filmmaker constructed a replica of the Taj Mahal at a cost of US $56 million dollars so that his impoverished countrymen in Bangladesh could enjoy the famous monument without traveling to India. The replication took five years to complete with modern equipment.
		<br>
		<br>
		<span class="tab"></span>15. A Taj-inspired luxury hotel, event, and shopping complex is under construction in Dubai. The Taj Arabia, as the replica is called, will be four times the size of the original and will cost an estimated US $1 billion. The 20-story glass hotel will contain 350 luxury rooms.
